            "content": " <b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><br><br> \
                        Fundamentally, the arbitration agreement plays a prominent role in determination of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. \
                        Herein, the concepts of Kompetenz-Kompetenz and Separability not play a prominent role in protecting and promoting the rights of the parties to arbitration but also are considered extremely important in terms of international arbitration as they form the basis of the applicability, jurisdiction and functioning of the arbitral tribunal. <br><br><br>\
                        \
                        <b><u>MAIN BODY</u></b><br><br> \
                        The concept of separability fundamentally lays emphasis on the principle that the arbitration agreement is separate from the main and substantive contract. Herein, in case if the main contract is declared void, invalid or ceases to exist, the validity of the arbitration agreement will not be in question and it will continue to exist. \
                        Pertinently, the arbitration agreement survives for the fundamental goal of determining the claims which result due to the violation as well determination of the mode of settlement.  The said concept is imperative to ensure the functioning of arbitration when the tribunal deals with an issue governing its jurisdiction of the subject matter of the dispute. <br><br> \
                        Fundamentally, <b>Article 16 as well as 23(1) of the Model Law</b> lays emphasis on the doctrine of separability wherein it states that the arbitral tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction which pertinently includes issues regarding the validity, enforcement as well as existence of the arbitration agreement and herein for facilitating the objective of the same, \
                        the arbitration clause which is part of a main contract will be treated as an independent agreement from the other clauses. For instance, if the arbitral tribunal declares the main contract null and void, then the same shall not ipse jure invalidate the arbitration clause. In terms of the English Arbitration Act, <b>Section 7</b>  also reiterates the above-mentioned law and prescribes that until \
                        and unless it is agreed by the parties to the contract, the arbitration agreement will not be ineffective or invalid as a result of the main contract and it must be pertinently treated as a separate and distinct agreement. Furthermore, in terms of the Swiss Federal Code <b>Article 178(3)</b>  emphasises that the validity of the arbitration agreement cannot be challenged on the rationale that the main contract is invalid. \
                        In the landmark case of <b>Fiona Trust v. Privalov</b> , the court emphasised on two main principles: Firstly, the issue regarding validity of the arbitration agreement shall be decided by the arbitral tribunal and not the court. Secondly, the allegation of invalidity of the main contract does not affect the validity of the arbitration clause. \
                        Furthermore, in the case of <b>Sulamerica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA v. Enesa Engenharia</b> , the Court of Appeal laid substantial emphasis on the chief purpose of the doctrine of separability, wherein it stated that the purpose is to give legal effect to the intention of the parties of resolving their disputes by the means of arbitration and not to separate the arbitration agreement from the main contract. \
                        Also, <b>the Singapore High Court in BCY v BCZ</b> upheld the rationale rendered in the above-mentioned precedent and rendered that the under the doctrine the parties cannot abolish or avoid the obligation to submit the said dispute to arbitration pertinently because of the existence of the main contract. <br><br> \
                        Hence, the concept of separability is an essential tool for the smooth and effective conduct of international arbitration. <br><br> \
                        On the other hand, the concept of Kompetenz-Kompetenz lays fundamental emphasis on the power of the arbitration tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction. The concept is enshrined in <b>Article 16(1) of the Model Law</b> , wherein it illustrates the power of the arbitrator to determine all or part of the issues in matters governing arbitration. \
                        Also <b>Rule 6.3 of the ICC Rules</b> illustrates that any plea with regard to the existence, validity and scope of the arbitration agreement can be decided together in an individual arbitration by the arbitral tribunal. Furthermore, <b>Rule 6.5</b>  illustrates that any decision in relation of the jurisdiction of the arbitration, except claims of parties before the court, shall be decided by the tribunal itself. \
                        In terms of the English Arbitration Act, <b>Section 30</b>  prescribes that the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own substantive jurisdiction. <br><br> \
                        In the landmark case of <b>Dallah v. Government of Pakistan</b> , the Pakistani government denied being a party to the arbitration agreement with Dallah as well as raised arguments against the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Herein, adopting the above-mentioned concept of law, the arbitral tribunal ruled on its own jurisdiction and rendered that the Government of Pakistan was indeed a proper party to the arbitration agreement and bound by the said clause. \
                        Also, furthermore, the UK Supreme Court rendered that even though the tribunal has the power to review and determine its own jurisdiction, the said can be subject to review by court of law. While, the case of <b>First Option of Chicago v. Kaplan</b> rendered a contrasting view that the question of existence \
                        and validity of the agreement is a matter for determination in the court of law unless there is apt and undeniable evidence that the parties have agreed to submit the issue to the arbitral tribunal. <br><br> \
                        Furthermore, in the case of <b>Harbour Assurance Co Limited v. Kansa General International Insuarance</b>, it was rendered that the main contract as well as obligation to arbitrate are separate and distinct and herein the arbitrators in principle have the power to determine the jurisdiction of the tribunal. <br><br><br> \
                        \
                        <b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b><br><br> \
                        Principally, it can be concluded that on one hand, the concept of separability preserves the autonomy of the arbitration agreement from the main contract, while, on the other hand, the concept of kompetenz-konpetenz gives power to the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. Hence, they come at different stages of arbitration and are not similar to one another although they both originate from the modern liberal laws on arbitration.  "

            "image": "images/article2.jpg",
            "content": "<b>INTRODUCTION</b> \
                        <br><br> \
                        Arbitration can be fundamentally enumerated as a method of dispute resolution under the Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism wherein parties mutually agree to refer all or any of the disputes arising out of their contractual relationship to arbitration. Herein, the award which is rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal is binding on the parties. \
                        Fundamentally, it is a method for settling disputes that sits outside the court. Martin Domke defines arbitration as voluntarily referring to a dispute to a third party selected by them for decision based on evidence and arguments, presented before the arbitration tribunal and the award of the arbitrator is final and binding. \
                        Furthermore, an arbitration agreement can either be in form of an agreement under a main contract or a separate agreement in itself. For instance, in relation to the former, a contract between company A and B involving sale of goods involves a clause for arbitration in case of a dispute. While, on the other hand, in terms of a separate agreement, the parties can directly refer the dispute to arbitration if they have mutually consented to. \
                        <br><br><br> \
                        \
                        <b>ANALYSIS</b> \
                        <br><br> \
                        Fundamentally, the process of adding a third party as a party to an arbitration is known as Joinder.  This procedure, which is typically associated with multi-party and/or multi-contract arbitration, helps to reduce the time and expenses associated with a dispute involving more than two parties. An international arbitral tribunal must necessarily decide the extent and consequences of its jurisdiction before it may decide to include one or more non-signatory in the arbitral proceedings. \
                        The autonomy of the arbitration agreement, which forms the basis of the arbitral tribunal's authority, is a well-established principle in international arbitration. <br><br> \
                        The <b>International Court of Arbitration</b> pertinently falls under the purview of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and can be enumerated as an institution established for the purpose of effective resolution of International commercial dispute. Herein, Art 7 emphasises the rules and regulations governing the joinder of Additional Parties, wherein the party who intends to join the arbitration must submit a Request for Joinder to the Secretariat. <br><br>\
                        Herein, the timing of such a request is considered essential, as the date on which the Secretariat receives such a request, it will be deemed that arbitration has been initiated against the additional third party. Pertinently, a third-party cannot join arbitration after constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal until and unless it is decided by the Arbitrator and the third-party has consented to the formation of the tribunal. \
                        Furthermore, <b>Art 7(5)</b> stipulates that the tribunal must take into consideration a series of important factors as well as the pertinent circumstances governing the case, which include, (i) If the arbitral tribunal has prime facie jurisdiction over the third additional party, (ii) the severity of the impact of the joinder on the effective and efficient conduct of arbitration procedure and (iii) any prospective issues or conflicts. \
                        Also, <b>Art 9</b> prescribes that, if the arbitrator allows the joinder of an additional party, several claims arising out of different contracts, can be dealt in a single arbitration proceeding. For instance, in the case of <b>Chowtaw Generation v. American Home Assurance</b>, the court of law, while deciding on the issue of whether consent could be derived from a non-signatory under arbitrary estoppel rendered that, \
                        even though the Plaintiff had a different contract with the Respondent and the Third party, however, the Intellectual Property Rights (IP) were related and hence, the said can be implied as consent. Therefore, one of the pertinent benefits of the same is minimizing the multiplicity of cases involving the same subject matter and strengthening the parties perception of justice. <br><br> \
                        <u>The following are a series of landmark precedents governing non-signatories:</u><br> \
                        Fundamentally, the Group of Companies doctrine can be enumerated as a legal principle wherein a company that is a non-signatory to the arbitration agreement will be bound by the same if such a company is a member of the same group of companies who have signed the agreement. <br> \
                        <b>Firstly</b>, the landmark case of <b>Dow Chemical v. Isover Gobain</b> can be emphasised as the primary and most relevant arbitral award wherein an arbitration clause was extended to non-signatories pertinently because they were widely and actively involved in the execution, discussion and termination of two agreements which were governed by an ICC arbitration clause. The said award was upheld by the court of the seat of arbitration (France) and has acted a fundamental precedent and basis for court of law assuming jurisdiction over non-signatories in diverse other cases. \
                        Herein, placing reliance on the same, the courts in France, have rendered that active participation in negotiation of the contract as well as performance of the contract by the non-signatories can bind them to the arbitration agreement. <br><br> \
                        On the other hand, in the case of <b>Dallah v. Government of Pakistan</b>, the issue before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of UK was whether Government of Pakistan could be considered as a party to arbitration. Herein, the court emphasised the principle of Party Autonomy and rendered that if there was no appropriate consent under the applicable legislation, the arbitral tribunal could not grant itself jurisdiction and could only have jurisdiction by consent. \
                        The existence of consent is considered essential. Furthermore, the court also emphasised that there was no common intention between the Government of Pakistan and Dallah in the instant case to make the former a party to arbitration and hence, rendered that a non-signatory cannot be a party to arbitration. Similarly, in the case of <b>Peterson Farms v. C &M Framing Limited</b>, the English Court rejected the applicability of the Group of companies' doctrine under the English law. <br><br> \
                        <u>The following are the issues associated with joinder of additional party to arbitration:</u><br> \
                        The consent of the existing parties to arbitration is impaired and vitiated. Herein, the principle of party autonomy refers to the party's ability to carry out the arbitration process as they see fit. It is termed as the guiding principle, widely, since the legality of the arbitration procedure as a whole rest on the agreement of the parties involved. In relation to the same, the case of <b>PT First Media v. Astro Nusantara International</b> the court of law rendered that the reasoning behind why arbitral awards binds the parties is that they have given their consent to be bound by the repercussions of agreeing to govern their dispute by arbitration. \
                        Therefore, party autonomy is one of the key principles of arbitration. Furthermore, in another case of <b>GE Energy Power Conversion France v. Outokumpu Stainless USA</b>, the court emphasised on the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal while enforcing the arbitration agreement, must give importance and effect to the rights and expectations of the parties to the agreement. In terms of the ICC legislation governing Joinder of third parties, Art 7(5) as enumerated above, is a violation of the principle of party autonomy, as under the said provision of law, \
                        a third party who has consented to join arbitration upon making a request, will be deemed as a party to the arbitration even if the other parties to the arbitration agreement do not consent to it. Herein, the Singapore High Court in the case of <b>CJD v. CJE</b> emphasised the importance of consent and rendered that a third party should be allowed to join arbitration only if there is an express agreement between the parties. For instance, reputable arbitration institutions such as the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) mandates the requirement of consent of all the parties involved. \
                        <br><br><br> \
                        \
                        <b>CONCLUSION</b> \
                        <br><br> \
                        Thus, fundamentally, multi-party arbitration has a series of advantages associated with it, one of which, is reducing the multiplicity of proceedings wherein the subject matter of the dispute involved is same in nature. However, the said advantages must not be achieved at the expense of the principle of party autonomy, which is core and central to the process of arbitration. \
                        Herein, although the latest ICC Arbitration Rules 2021, stipulate factors such as impact of the joinder of third-party on the arbitration procedure, but does not emphasise the mandate of consent of the other parties involved. Therefore, it is essential to protect and uphold the principle of party autonomy for the effective conduct of arbitration. "
