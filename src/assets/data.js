      "DOCTRINE OF SEPERABILITY UNDER ARBITRATION AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SAID DOCTRINE AND THE DOCTRINE OF KOMPETENZ-KOMPETENZ",

    content:
      " <h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7><br><br> \
                        Fundamentally, the arbitration agreement plays a prominent role in determination of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. \
                        Herein, the concepts of Kompetenz-Kompetenz and Separability not play a prominent role in protecting and promoting the rights of the parties to arbitration but also are considered extremely important in terms of international arbitration as they form the basis of the applicability, jurisdiction and functioning of the arbitral tribunal. <br><br><br>\
                        \
                        <h7><b>MAIN BODY</b></h7><br><br> \
                        The concept of separability fundamentally lays emphasis on the principle that the arbitration agreement is separate from the main and substantive contract. Herein, in case if the main contract is declared void, invalid or ceases to exist, the validity of the arbitration agreement will not be in question and it will continue to exist. \
                        Pertinently, the arbitration agreement survives for the fundamental goal of determining the claims which result due to the violation as well determination of the mode of settlement<sup>1</sup>.  The said concept is imperative to ensure the functioning of arbitration when the tribunal deals with an issue governing its jurisdiction of the subject matter of the dispute. <br><br> \
                        Fundamentally, <b>Article 16 as well as 23(1) of the Model Law</b><sup>2</sup> lays emphasis on the doctrine of separability wherein it states that the arbitral tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction which pertinently includes issues regarding the validity, enforcement as well as existence of the arbitration agreement and herein for facilitating the objective of the same, \
                        the arbitration clause which is part of a main contract will be treated as an independent agreement from the other clauses. For instance, if the arbitral tribunal declares the main contract null and void, then the same shall not ipse jure invalidate the arbitration clause. In terms of the English Arbitration Act, <b>Section 7</b><sup>3</sup>  also reiterates the above-mentioned law and prescribes that until \
                        and unless it is agreed by the parties to the contract, the arbitration agreement will not be ineffective or invalid as a result of the main contract and it must be pertinently treated as a separate and distinct agreement. Furthermore, in terms of the Swiss Federal Code <b>Article 178(3)</b><sup>4</sup>  emphasises that the validity of the arbitration agreement cannot be challenged on the rationale that the main contract is invalid. \
                        In the landmark case of <b>Fiona Trust v. Privalov</b><sup>5</sup> , the court emphasised on two main principles: Firstly, the issue regarding validity of the arbitration agreement shall be decided by the arbitral tribunal and not the court. Secondly, the allegation of invalidity of the main contract does not affect the validity of the arbitration clause. \
                        Furthermore, in the case of <b>Sulamerica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA v. Enesa Engenharia</b><sup>6</sup> , the Court of Appeal laid substantial emphasis on the chief purpose of the doctrine of separability, wherein it stated that the purpose is to give legal effect to the intention of the parties of resolving their disputes by the means of arbitration and not to separate the arbitration agreement from the main contract. \
                        Also, <b>the Singapore High Court in BCY v BCZ</b><sup>7</sup> upheld the rationale rendered in the above-mentioned precedent and rendered that the under the doctrine the parties cannot abolish or avoid the obligation to submit the said dispute to arbitration pertinently because of the existence of the main contract. <br><br> \
                        Hence, the concept of separability is an essential tool for the smooth and effective conduct of international arbitration. <br><br> \
                        On the other hand, the concept of Kompetenz-Kompetenz lays fundamental emphasis on the power of the arbitration tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction.<sup>8</sup> The concept is enshrined in <b>Article 16(1) of the Model Law</b><sup>9</sup> , wherein it illustrates the power of the arbitrator to determine all or part of the issues in matters governing arbitration. \
                        Also <b>Rule 6.3 of the ICC Rules</b><sup>10</sup> illustrates that any plea with regard to the existence, validity and scope of the arbitration agreement can be decided together in an individual arbitration by the arbitral tribunal. Furthermore, <b>Rule 6.5</b><sup>11</sup>  illustrates that any decision in relation of the jurisdiction of the arbitration, except claims of parties before the court, shall be decided by the tribunal itself. \
                        In terms of the English Arbitration Act, <b>Section 30</b><sup>12</sup>  prescribes that the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own substantive jurisdiction. <br><br> \
                        In the landmark case of <b>Dallah v. Government of Pakistan</b><sup>13</sup> , the Pakistani government denied being a party to the arbitration agreement with Dallah as well as raised arguments against the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Herein, adopting the above-mentioned concept of law, the arbitral tribunal ruled on its own jurisdiction and rendered that the Government of Pakistan was indeed a proper party to the arbitration agreement and bound by the said clause. \
                        Also, furthermore, the UK Supreme Court rendered that even though the tribunal has the power to review and determine its own jurisdiction, the said can be subject to review by court of law. While, the case of <b>First Option of Chicago v. Kaplan</b><sup>14</sup> rendered a contrasting view that the question of existence \
                        and validity of the agreement is a matter for determination in the court of law unless there is apt and undeniable evidence that the parties have agreed to submit the issue to the arbitral tribunal. <br><br> \
                        Furthermore, in the case of <b>Harbour Assurance Co Limited v. Kansa General International Insuarance</b><sup>15</sup>, it was rendered that the main contract as well as obligation to arbitrate are separate and distinct and herein the arbitrators in principle have the power to determine the jurisdiction of the tribunal. <br><br><br> \
                        \
                        <h7><b>CONCLUSION</b></h7><br><br> \
                        Principally, it can be concluded that on one hand, the concept of separability preserves the autonomy of the arbitration agreement from the main contract, while, on the other hand, the concept of kompetenz-konpetenz gives power to the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. Hence, they come at different stages of arbitration and are not similar to one another although they both originate from the modern liberal laws on arbitration.  ",

      "EXTENSION OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT TO NON-SIGNATORY PARTIES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE MULTI-CONTRACT, MULTI-ACTION AND MULTI-PARTY ARBITRATIONS",
    image: "images/article2.jpg",
    content:
      "<h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7> \
                        <br><br> \
                        Arbitration can be fundamentally enumerated as a method of dispute resolution under the Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism wherein parties mutually agree to refer all or any of the disputes arising out of their contractual relationship to arbitration. Herein, the award which is rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal is binding on the parties. \
                        Fundamentally, it is a method for settling disputes that sits outside the court. Martin Domke defines arbitration as voluntarily referring to a dispute to a third party selected by them for decision based on evidence and arguments, presented before the arbitration tribunal and the award of the arbitrator is final and binding.<sup>1</sup> \
                        Furthermore, an arbitration agreement can either be in form of an agreement under a main contract or a separate agreement in itself. For instance, in relation to the former, a contract between company A and B involving sale of goods involves a clause for arbitration in case of a dispute. While, on the other hand, in terms of a separate agreement, the parties can directly refer the dispute to arbitration if they have mutually consented to.<sup>2</sup> \
                        <br><br><br> \
                        \
                        <h7><b>ANALYSIS</b></h7> \
                        <br><br> \
                        Fundamentally, the process of adding a third party as a party to an arbitration is known as Joinder.  This procedure, which is typically associated with multi-party and/or multi-contract arbitration, helps to reduce the time and expenses associated with a dispute involving more than two parties. An international arbitral tribunal must necessarily decide the extent and consequences of its jurisdiction before it may decide to include one or more non-signatory in the arbitral proceedings. \
                        The autonomy of the arbitration agreement, which forms the basis of the arbitral tribunal's authority, is a well-established principle in international arbitration. <br><br> \
                        The <b>International Court of Arbitration</b> pertinently falls under the purview of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and can be enumerated as an institution established for the purpose of effective resolution of International commercial dispute. Herein, <b>Art 7</b><sup>3</sup> emphasises the rules and regulations governing the joinder of Additional Parties, wherein the party who intends to join the arbitration must submit a Request for Joinder to the Secretariat. <br><br>\
                        Herein, the timing of such a request is considered essential, as the date on which the Secretariat receives such a request, it will be deemed that arbitration has been initiated against the additional third party. Pertinently, a third-party cannot join arbitration after constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal until and unless it is decided by the Arbitrator and the third-party has consented to the formation of the tribunal. \
                        Furthermore, <b>Art 7(5)</b><sup>4</sup> stipulates that the tribunal must take into consideration a series of important factors as well as the pertinent circumstances governing the case, which include, (i) If the arbitral tribunal has prime facie jurisdiction over the third additional party, (ii) the severity of the impact of the joinder on the effective and efficient conduct of arbitration procedure and (iii) any prospective issues or conflicts.<sup>5</sup> \
                        Also, <b>Art 9</b><sup>6</sup> prescribes that, if the arbitrator allows the joinder of an additional party, several claims arising out of different contracts, can be dealt in a single arbitration proceeding. For instance, in the case of <b>Chowtaw Generation v. American Home Assurance</b>,<sup>7</sup> the court of law, while deciding on the issue of whether consent could be derived from a non-signatory under arbitrary estoppel rendered that, \
                        even though the Plaintiff had a different contract with the Respondent and the Third party, however, the Intellectual Property Rights (IP) were related and hence, the said can be implied as consent. Therefore, one of the pertinent benefits of the same is minimizing the multiplicity of cases involving the same subject matter and strengthening the parties perception of justice. <br><br> \
                        <u>The following are a series of landmark precedents governing non-signatories:</u><br> \
                        Fundamentally, the Group of Companies doctrine can be enumerated as a legal principle wherein a company that is a non-signatory to the arbitration agreement will be bound by the same if such a company is a member of the same group of companies who have signed the agreement.<sup>8</sup> <br> \
                        <b>Firstly</b>, the landmark case of <b>Dow Chemical v. Isover Gobain</b><sup>9</sup> can be emphasised as the primary and most relevant arbitral award wherein an arbitration clause was extended to non-signatories pertinently because they were widely and actively involved in the execution, discussion and termination of two agreements which were governed by an ICC arbitration clause. The said award was upheld by the court of the seat of arbitration (France) and has acted a fundamental precedent and basis for court of law assuming jurisdiction over non-signatories in diverse other cases. \
                        Herein, placing reliance on the same, the courts in France, have rendered that active participation in negotiation of the contract as well as performance of the contract by the non-signatories can bind them to the arbitration agreement. <br><br> \
                        On the other hand, in the case of <b>Dallah v. Government of Pakistan</b>,<sup>10</sup> the issue before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of UK was whether Government of Pakistan could be considered as a party to arbitration. Herein, the court emphasised the principle of Party Autonomy and rendered that if there was no appropriate consent under the applicable legislation, the arbitral tribunal could not grant itself jurisdiction and could only have jurisdiction by consent. \
                        The existence of consent is considered essential. Furthermore, the court also emphasised that there was no common intention between the Government of Pakistan and Dallah in the instant case to make the former a party to arbitration and hence, rendered that a non-signatory cannot be a party to arbitration. Similarly, in the case of <b>Peterson Farms v. C &M Framing Limited</b>,<sup>11</sup> the English Court rejected the applicability of the Group of companies' doctrine under the English law. <br><br> \
                        <u>The following are the issues associated with joinder of additional party to arbitration:</u><br> \
                        The consent of the existing parties to arbitration is impaired and vitiated. Herein, the principle of party autonomy refers to the party's ability to carry out the arbitration process as they see fit. It is termed as the guiding principle, widely, since the legality of the arbitration procedure as a whole rest on the agreement of the parties involved. In relation to the same, the case of <b>PT First Media v. Astro Nusantara International</b><sup>12</sup> the court of law rendered that the reasoning behind why arbitral awards binds the parties is that they have given their consent to be bound by the repercussions of agreeing to govern their dispute by arbitration. \
                        Therefore, party autonomy is one of the key principles of arbitration. Furthermore, in another case of <b>GE Energy Power Conversion France v. Outokumpu Stainless USA</b>,<sup>13</sup> the court emphasised on the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal while enforcing the arbitration agreement, must give importance and effect to the rights and expectations of the parties to the agreement. In terms of the ICC legislation governing Joinder of third parties, <b>Art 7(5)</b><sup>14</sup> as enumerated above, is a violation of the principle of party autonomy, as under the said provision of law, \
                        a third party who has consented to join arbitration upon making a request, will be deemed as a party to the arbitration even if the other parties to the arbitration agreement do not consent to it. Herein, the Singapore High Court in the case of <b>CJD v. CJE</b><sup>15</sup> emphasised the importance of consent and rendered that a third party should be allowed to join arbitration only if there is an express agreement between the parties. For instance, reputable arbitration institutions such as the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) mandates the requirement of consent of all the parties involved. \
                        <br><br><br> \
                        \
                        <h7><b>CONCLUSION</b></h7> \
                        <br><br> \
                        Thus, fundamentally, multi-party arbitration has a series of advantages associated with it, one of which, is reducing the multiplicity of proceedings wherein the subject matter of the dispute involved is same in nature. However, the said advantages must not be achieved at the expense of the principle of party autonomy, which is core and central to the process of arbitration. \
                        Herein, although the latest ICC Arbitration Rules 2021, stipulate factors such as impact of the joinder of third-party on the arbitration procedure, but does not emphasise the mandate of consent of the other parties involved. Therefore, it is essential to protect and uphold the principle of party autonomy for the effective conduct of arbitration. ",

      " \
      <p> “In case of any dispute or claim arising out of this Contract, the Parties shall first seek to resolve the dispute or claim by friendly discussion. Any Party may notify the other Party of its desire to enter into consultation to resolve a dispute or claim. If no solution can be arrived at in between the Parties for a continuous period of 4 (four) weeks then the Parties will endeavour to resolve the matter through Swiss arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration. The number of arbitrators shall be three (3). ICC shall be the appointing authority acting in accordance with the rules adopted by ICC for that purpose. Should a resolution not be forthcoming the courts of England shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction”.</p> \
      \
      <br> \
      <h6><b><u>TOPIC A: Law governing the Arbitration Dispute</u></b></h6> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>An arbitration agreement can be fundamentally referred to as an agreement between the parties to refer all or any of the disputes arising out of their contractual relationship to arbitration. The purpose of the same is: (i) For evidentiary value, (ii) To establish the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and (iii) set out the procedure for the parties to the arbitration to follow. </p> \
       \
      <h6><b>ANALYSIS</b></h6> \
       \
      <p>In the instant case, the <b>Conflicts of law approach</b> will apply which emphasises that if there are several national laws being implicated in the same dispute, one needs to look at different connections and apply the law that is most closely connected to the dispute.<sup>1</sup></p> \
      <p>The landmark case of <b>Sulamerica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA v. Enesa Engenharia</b><sup>2</sup> fundamentally lays down the guidelines for determination of the law governing the arbitration agreement. Herein, under the English Law approach, a three-prong approach is prescribed which is as follows: (i) Express Choice: There is a law governing the arbitration prescribed in the arbitration agreement expressly. (ii) Implied Choice: there isn’t any law governing arbitration prescribed in the arbitration agreement but it can be implied by conduct or acts of the parties. (iii) Closest and most real connection. \
      In the said case, there were two policies in their agreement: arbitration in London and Brazilian law will govern any dispute that arises. The governing law for the substantive contract was Brazilian law and Brazilian courts had the exclusive jurisdiction. Upon a dispute, Sulamerica initiated arbitration in London, whereas Enesa started proceedings in Brazilian courts. The issue was which law determines the applicable law. Herein, the High Court rendered that the law of the seat is the law that will apply. The Brazilian law and the agreement to its application is irrelevant by emphasizing on the principle of separability. Using the three-prong approach, the closest connection here is the seat of the arbitration. \
      The arbitration clause in this case was a part of an adhesion contract. Multiple national courts are of the opinion that an arbitration clause in an adhesion contract is not valid unless the insured party consents to it. Hence, the law of the seat (Lex Loci Arbitri) will apply.  The court of appeal reiterated. Hence, the principle which is of substantive importance here is that the intention of the parties to arbitrate must be taken into due consideration. </p> \
      <p>Furthermore, in the case of <b>Enka v. Chubb</b><sup>3</sup>, Chubb was the insurer, who paid out the insurance policy and brought a claim against Enka, the party who caused the damage. Chubb brought a claim in the Russian court. Whereas, Enka contended that there is an arbitration clause, and that would decide the dispute. Chubb maintained that they did not agree to arbitration. Enka filed an anti-suit injunction in the English courts. Herein, the Court of appeal rendered that in the absence of agreement between parties in relation to an express and implied choice of law governing their arbitration, the law of the seat (Lex Loci Arbitri) will be applicable. The Supreme court upheld with the said rationale. </p> \
      <p>In the case of <b>Kout Food Group v. Kabab Ji</b><sup>4</sup> the fundamental question before the UK Supreme Court was which law shall apply to the arbitration agreement. Herein, it agreed with the principles rendered in the above-mentioned case and held that since the arbitration is at the stage of enforcement, pursuant to <b>Article V(1)(a)</b><sup>5</sup> the law applicable will either be the law of the seat or the law which parties agreed. </p> \
      <p>Furthermore, <b>Article 35 of the UNCITRAL Rules</b><sup>6</sup>, emphasises that the tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties. <b>Article 16.4 of the LCIA Rules</b><sup>7</sup> prescribes that the law governing the arbitration must be the law of the seat. </p> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>CONCLUSION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Hence, in the instant arbitration clause, the parties have prescribed resolution of the matter through Swiss Arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration, there is suitable evidence to ascertain the law under which the parties intend to carry out their arbitration. Herein, the law governing the arbitration agreement will be the <b>LCIA Rules</b> as the parties have mentioned that the dispute will be governed by the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). </p> \
      <br> \
      <h6><b><u>TOPIC B: Validity and Enforceability of the Arbitration clause</u></b></h6> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Fundamentally, <b>Article II(i) of New York Convention</b><sup>8</sup> illustrates the requirements for a valid arbitration agreement which includes: (i) Agreement in writing, (ii) arisng out of a legal relationship and (iii) must be capable of being resolved by arbitration. Furthermore, (a) Substantive validity – consent, capacity and (b) Formal validity – additional procedural requirement. Herein, in terms of substantive validity, consent can be enumerated in form of: (a) By signing a contract or (b) By conduct. While, capacity – the authority to give consent and agree to arbitration. Also, formal validity includes procedure such as agreement in writing as well as signature of parties etc.<sup>9</sup> </p> \

      <p>The following are the potential problems with the said arbitration agreement: <b>(i)</b> The clause mentions parties shall first seek to resolve the dispute by friendly discussion. Herein, the word friendly is used which can give rise to mediation and other Alternate dispute resolution proceedings. Herein, since arbitration is similar to the court of law, wherein the arbitrator hears both the parties and analyses the evidence before rendering an award, which is binding on the parties, the word friendly has no association with it. Also, the said can fall under the category of hybrid arbitration, wherein, parties use other forms of dispute resolution before arbitration. <b>(ii)</b> The clause mentions any parties can express desire to enter into consultation and the time limit for reaching a solution is 4 weeks, herein, the time limit can impose act as a burden or obligation on the parties to reach a hasty solution if they want to avoid going to arbitration. \
      <b>(iii)</b> The clause mentions the number of arbitrators but does not prescribe the procedure for the appointment of the arbitrators which in turn makes it ambiguous and can give rise to a dispute on impartiality of arbitrator. <b>(iv)</b> The clause mentions ICC as the appointment authority, which is contradictory as it has mentioned earlier that the arbitration will be governed by LCIA Rules. (v) The clause provides the jurisdiction of the English courts in case of no resolution. However, under arbitration, the arbitrator will render an award after hearing the parties and the same will be binding on the parties and cannot be appealed to the court of law on merits. </p> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>CONCLUSION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Since, in the instant case, there are several defaults in the arbitration agreement, it is not possible to ascertain whether the said clause is valid and enforceable or not. Herein, the arbitration tribunal and the court of law will have jurisdiction to determine the same. </p> \

    content:
      " \
      \
      <h6><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h6> \
       \
      <p>The purpose of the IBA Guidelines on the collection of Evidence is to provide a productive, practical, and fair process on the taking of evidence by offering tribunals guidelines on how to gather evidence after consulting with the parties on relevant issues. These Guidelines were not meant to replace existing in force institutional regulations rather, they were meant to serve as a link between the common law and civil law traditions. Taking into consideration that these guidelines are non-binding in nature, it is the discretion of the parties to be bound by them. The Guidelines include provisions for dealing with witnesses, experts, documents as well as evidentiary value and admissibility of evidence.<sup>1</sup> </p> \
      <br> \
      <h6><b>MAIN BODY</b></h6> \
      <p><u>IN ADHERENCE TO DOCUMENT PRODUCTION</u>, in terms of the regulatory approaches, fundamentally, <b>Sec. 34(2)(d)</b><sup>2</sup> emphasises that, it’s the discretion of the tribunal to determine which classes of documents should be disclosed and produced by the parties at what stage of the proceedings. Fundamentally, production of documents is considered an essential process in arbitration pertinently because it can be emphasised as an important step which can prospectively determine the outcome of the issue. Herein, following are the requirements for production of documents pursuant to the <b>International Bar Association Rules on taking of evidence in International Arbitration 2020:</b> </p> \
      <p><b>Art 3(3)</b><sup>3</sup> emphasises that a request should contain: (i) Description of each requested document sufficient to identify it and the description in sufficient detail of a narrow and specific requested category of documents. Furthermore, <b>Art 3(3)(b)</b> a request should also contain a statement as to how the documents requested are relevant to the case and material to its outcome and there should be no fishing expeditions and early requests. Furthermore, <b>Art 3(3)(c)</b> emphasises that when documents is in custody, possession or control of another party, it would be unreasonably burdensome requesting other party to produce such documents. \
      In terms of Confidentiality of documents, <b>Art 13</b><sup>4</sup> enumerates that any document which is submitted by the party or non-party in the arbitration and is not available in the public domain at large shall be kept confidential by the Tribunal and the parties and must be only used in relation and adherence to the matters governing the arbitration. The following has an exception wherein., disclosure may be required of a Party to fulfil a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings before a state court or other judicial authority. \
      While, in terms of Privilege, <b>Art 9(2)(a)</b> emphasises that the tribunal can exclude evidence or production of evidence for privilege and legal impediment. Furthermore, <b>Art 9(2)(b)</b> emphasises that privilege may arise from legal advice and settlement negotiations. Also, in case of consequences of Non-production, <b>Art 9(5)</b> emphasises adverse interferences which the tribunal can draw in case of non-production of documents.<sup>5</sup>  </p> \
      <p>In terms of <u>cultural approaches</u>, in <b>Civil Law Jurisdictions</b>, the pleading party is often only needed to provide evidence that it intends to rely. It is common for a party making a discovery request to be required to provide specific documents in a way that complies with its procedural laws. While, in relation to <b>Common Law Jurisdictions</b>, discovery or disclosure in common law is typically far more comprehensive. It is customary practise for the parties to ask each other for evidence. Herein, extensive discovery requests are frequently required, and document demands can be rather expansive. Parties must disclose all documents relevant to the case.<sup>6</sup> </p> \
      <p><u>IN ADHERENCE TO EXPERT WITNESSES</u>, they can be enumerated as individuals who have a specialised and certain set of knowledge and skill in a particular field and are called upon to give their opinion on the facts of the case. In terms of the regulatory approaches, Fundamentally, experts can be appointed in the following manner: (i) Party appointed and (ii) Tribunal appointed. <b>Art 5</b><sup>7</sup> emphasises party appointed experts, wherein, parties are permitted to appoint and rely on their own experts and they must cover the cost of their experts. Herein, the issue of impartiality pertinently arises wherein, pursuant to <b>Art 5(2)(b)</b>, experts must disclose instructions and provide a statement of independence from the parties and their legal advisors. \
       Furthermore, experts will have to appear and will be cross examined as well. Pursuant to <b>Art 5(4) of the IBA</b>, the tribunal has discretion to order experts to meet and confer in an attempt to reach agreement and record same in writing. Also, the tribunal may ask them to appear together before it and answer questions by the tribunal which is pertinently referred to as hot tubing. Furthermore, <b>Art 6</b><sup>8</sup> emphasises tribunal appointed experts and herein emphasising the mandate of impartiality, the tribunal appointed experts must be independent as enumerated in <b>Art 6(1) and 6(2)</b>. Furthermore, Art 6(4) emphasises that the experts must report to the tribunal in writing, while, <b>Art 6(5)</b> states that a copy must be provided to the parties. Also, <b>Art 6(6)</b> emphasises that the parties have the right to cross examine experts at the hearing. </p> \
       <p>In terms of <u>cultural approaches</u>, in <b>Civil Law Jurisdictions</b>, the judge is considered as the primary investigator, while emphasises is laid on tribunal appointed experts, who form an important part of the investigation. While, in <b>Common Law Jurisdictions</b>, emphasis is laid on party appointed experts, wherein parties can appoint expert witnesses to back their claims on technical and scientific matters and the said witness can be cross examined by the other party. </p> \
       <p><u>IN ADHERENCE TO FACTUAL WITNESSES</u>, they can be enumerated as witnesses who were present during the dispute or have lived the dispute. They are prominently relied on by the legal representatives and arbitral tribunals as a means of filling in the gaps due to lack of documentary evidence. In terms of regulatory approaches, <b>Art 4</b><sup>9</sup> enumerates witnesses of fact wherein, the arbitral tribunal sets a time-period for both the parties to identify and nominate witnesses whose testimony they want to rely upon. Herein. <b>Art 4(5)</b> states that a witness’s statement must contain, (i) the name and address of the witnesses as well as their relationship between the parties, (ii) a comprehensive and complete description of the facts as well as (iii) an affirmation of truth. While, <b>Art 4(7)</b> states that if a witness fails to appear without a valid reason, the statement of such a witness must be disregarded. </p> \
       <p>In terms of <u>cultural approaches</u>, in <b>Civil Law Jurisdictions</b>, less emphasises is given on cross examination of factual witnesses, while, on the other hand, in <b>Common Law Jurisdictions</b>, substantial emphasis is given to the right of cross examination of factual witnesses by the other party. </p> \

      " \
      <h6><b>Arbitratbility of Disputes</b></h6> \
       \
      <ol> \
        <li>The underlying dispute relates to the sale of weapons to a para-military organization in a Central African state involved in a long-term civil war. The para-military organization is not formally classified as a terrorist organization by the United Nations.</li> \
        <li>The underlying dispute seems to be influenced by bribery involved in the procurement of the contract although there is no evidence that bribery was involved in the contract before the tribunal; in addition, there is no evidence that bribery was in relation to a governmental official, merely that a middle person was involved to “secure the contract”.</li> \
        <li>The respondent and party to the arbitration agreement seems to have become insolvent.</li> \
        <li>The subject matter seems to involve a significant violation of competition law both in the EU and the USA</li> \
      </ol> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Fundamentally, <b>Article II(i) of the New York Convention</b>: Fundamentally deals with the issue of whether the subject matter is capable of settlement by means of arbitration. Whether there exists a contract and the said can be enforced. Fundamentally deals with validity of the agreement. </p> \
      <p><b>Article V:</b> The recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award can be refused by the competent authority in the country where it is sought if: The subject matter is not capable of being resolved by the means of arbitration under the law of that country (national law). </p> \
      <p>Fundamentally, the ability of the arbitrators is compared to the national judges. Herein, cases dealing with criminal matters or matrimonial disputes cannot be effectively resolved by means of arbitration. Also, certain matters involving the rights of other parties are not arbitrable. \
      Basically, disputes which affects the rights of other parties or the society at large cannot be resolved by arbitrable. Herein: Right in rem: Society at large, cannot be arbitrable. On the other hand, Right in persona: Individual and personal, can be arbitrable. For instance, consumer disputes as well as Intellectual property rights disputes cannot be resolved by arbitration. Herein, the question of the best forum for resolution of the dispute comes into due consideration.  </p> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>ANALYSIS</b></h7> \
      <br> \
      <ol> \
        <li>The said issue cannot be referred to arbitration and the arbitration tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to deal with the issue. Herein, since, the said issue pertinently deals with sale of weapons, it falls within the purview of Criminal matters and hence is not arbitrable in accordance with <b>Art V(2)(a)</b> which emphasises that the subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of the country. Herein, in the case of <b>Fincatieri v. M and Arbitration Tribunal</b> the Swiss Federal Tribunal laid emphasis on the fact that issues which are in violation of public policy or which fall outside the jurisdiction and scope of arbitration cannot be resolved by the arbitrator. </li> \
        <br> \
        <li>The said issue cannot be referred to arbitration and the arbitration tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to deal with the issue. Herein, since, the said issue pertinently deals with bribery, it falls within the purview of Criminal matters and hence is not arbitrable in accordance with <b>Art V(2)(a)</b>. It is also a violation of public policy. Although, there is no evidence of bribery involved in the contract before the tribunal, since the case is pertinently dealing with bribery as well as the mere fact that involves a middle person as well which in turn gives rise to third party rights, the matter is not arbitrable. In the case of <b>Hubco v. Wardathe</b> Supreme court of Pakistan held that in case of prime facie evidence of fraud or corruption, the matter cannot be resolved by an arbitrator. </li> \
        <br> \
        <li>The said issue can be referred to arbitration and the arbitration tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide the said issue. If the respondent and party to the arbitration agreement have become insolvent, the matter may still be arbitrable unless the arbitration agreement specifically bars insolvency from being referred to Arbitration. In the case of <b>Elektrim v Vivendi</b>, it was rendered that insolvency does not affect the validity of an arbitration agreement. In another case, the Swiss Federal Tribunal rendered that insolvency in Portugal has no bearing of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal in Geneva. </li> \
        <br> \
        <li>The said issue cannot be referred to arbitration and the arbitration tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to decide the said issue. Since, the said issue involves a significant violation of competition law in both EU and USA, it is not arbitrable. Issues involving violation of Competition Law and Antitrust are not arbitrable as they fall within the purview of Right in rem and falls within the purview of Art V(2)(a). In the case of <b>Eco Swiss China Limited v. Benetton Limited</b>, it was rendered that the principles of res judicata prevails over treaty rules governing competition protection. </li> \

                <li>The UK Supreme Court decision on Haliburton v Chubb may work well in the English context but it is not a decision consistent with international arbitration practice. </li> \
            <br><br>\
            <h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7> \
            <br><br> \
            <p>The concept of Arbitration is a kind of quasi-judicial Alternative Conflict Resolution in which an additional third-party is selected to solve any sort of conflicts governing the individuals concerned. The said concept is governed by principles of natural justice on universal front which includes the principle of “<b>nemo judex in causa sua</b>” which means, no one can be a judge in their own cause”. Herein, the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator forms the crux and essence of ensuring legitimacy and efficiency of the arbitration process.</p> \
            \
            <br> \
            <h7><b>ANALYSIS</b></h7> \
            <br><br> \
            <p><u>In relation to the first issue</u>, the case of <b>Jivraz v. Hashwani</b> can be enumerated as the landmark precedent governing the Arbitrators contract with the disputing party or the arbitration institution. The facts of the case are as follows: In <b>1981</b>, the Plaintiff and the Respondent entered into a joint venture which included an arbitration agreement wherein in case of a prospective conflict between the parties, it would be resolved by arbitration before 3 arbitrators who should be members of the Ismaili Community. Furthermore, in <b>1988</b>, a dispute was resolved by the 3 members of the Ismaili Community as stipulated by the arbitration agreement. \
            However, in <b>2008</b>, one of the parties to the agreement initiated arbitration and appointed a retired English Judge as the sole arbitrator, which in turn was a violation of the arbitration agreement and hence, the opposing party-initiated court proceedings to declare the said appointment as void in nature. One of the pertinent questions before the court of law was whether the arbitrator’s contract was a contract of employment. Herein, the <b>High Court</b> rendered that the arbitrator’s contract was not a contract of employment pertinently because arbitrators are appointed to arbitrate a dispute between the parties and are not in crux employed by the parties. \
            For instance, the role of an arbitrator is similar to that of the judge, wherein, he/she has to hear the parties and examine the evidence available and render an award which is enforceable in nature and herein, the parties are bound by such an arbitral award. On appeal, the <b>Court of Appeal</b> rendered that the arbitrator was an employee of the appointing parties and rendered services under a “contract personally to do any work”. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of UK unanimously overruled the decision of the Court of Appeal and rendered that the role of an arbitrator is not pertinently defined as one of employment and rather he/she falls within the purview of a quasi-judicial authority. \
            To elaborate the same, the SC emphasised that an arbitrator is an independent service provider whose relationship with the parties is not on the basis of subordination. Also, although the arbitrator provides services on a personal basis for the purpose of earning fees but the said is not under the purview and direction of the parties. Therefore, on the basis of the above-mentioned precedent it can be concluded that the arbitrator’s contract with the parties or the arbitral institution is not a contract of employment but rather a justice provider. </p> \
            \
            <p><u>In relation to the second issue</u>, the regulatory framework governing arbitrators includes: (i) Arbitration rules and regulations such as ICC, LCIA which includes provisions for appointment as well as effective conduct of proceedings. (ii) International Conventions such as the New York Convention for Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Award, which contains key provisions for enforceability of arbitral awards. (iii) National laws such as the English Arbitration Act, 1996 as well as (iv) Soft law rules such as International Bar Association Guidelines on Conflict of Interest in International Arbitration. </p> \
            <p>Fundamentally, soft law rules do not pertinently provide an adequate framework for arbitrators. Herein, soft law rules such as the IBA Guidelines can be enumerated as non-binding rules and regulations which act as a supplement to the regulatory framework mentioned above. Although, IBA Guidelines are prominently respected and consistently employed by the arbitrators, they have certain limitations. <b>Firstly</b>, taking into consideration that these guidelines are non-binding in nature, it is the discretion of the parties to be bound by them. Herein, the issue of inconsistency in application as well as the lack of enforceability come into consideration. \
             <b>Secondly</b>, IBA guidelines pertinently act as a supplement to Institutional rules and regulations and herein in case the institution does not accept or promote the said guidelines or if there is an overlap between the rules, the applicability of the guidelines is condensed. <b>Thirdly</b>, there is a pertinent issue of lack of uniformity as the guidelines are interpreted and applied diversely by arbitrators. Lastly, in case complexity, the guidelines might not cover all the issues governing arbitration. Therefore, soft law rules are not adequate in nature and must be relied by the arbitrator as a supplement to the institutional rules and regulations to fill gaps.</p> \
             <p><u>In relation to the third and last issue</u>, Independence mandates that there be no such dependent relationship, either past or present, between the parties and the arbitrators that might potentially impair the arbitrator's discretion. While, Impartiality mandates that an arbitrator be impartial toward all parties involved and not biased toward the issue at hand. <b>Art 12 of Model Law</b> emphasises that the appointment of an arbitrator can be challenged only if there is justifiable grounds regarding his independence and impartiality. The same is reiterated in <b>Sec. 24 of the English Arbitration Act</b>. Fundamentally, the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator is essential to the procedure, as emphasised in the landmark case of <b>Perkins Eastman v. HSCC.</b> </p> \
             <p>Fundamentally, the arbitrator has a duty to disclose all relevant facts and the said duty derives its authority from not only prominent arbitration rules and regulations but also the agreement between the parties and the arbitrator. Herein, IBA Guidelines prescribes the following lists governing disclosure by the arbitrator: (i) Non- waivable red: Arbitrator should not act even with the consent of the parties, (ii) Waivable red: Instances which can potentially lead to disqualification and may be accepted by way of an express agreement between the parties, (iii) Orange: non-exhaustive list of instances which may give rise to justifiable doubts regarding independence and impartiality and (iv) Green:  No conflict of interest. </p> \
             <p>The landmark case of <b>Harlington v. Chubb</b> governs the process of determining whether there is a bias by the arbitrator and also emphasises what kind of disclosures the arbitrator must make. In the instant case, the SC was called upon to ascertain whether the Chairman of Bermuda Form Arbitration should be terminated on the basis that he was appointed in two other arbitrations. Herein, not only was the Respondent was directly involved in the two other arbitrations but also the legal representations were engaged. Herein, the arbitrator did not disclose the said fact to the Petitioner. Therefore, the said appointment was challenged by the Petitioner on the grounds that it gave rise to justifiable grounds to impartiality on the basis that: (i) the arbitrator’s consent to the same law firm's selections in the second and third arbitrations, and (ii) his neglect to notify Halliburton or a chance to object the same. \
             The High Court, Court of Appeal as well as the UK Supreme Court dismissed the applications and emphasised that although there is a legal duty to disclose on behalf of the arbitrator, but it is important to take into consideration the circumstances of the case. Herein, although the obligation of impartiality is the crux of English and arbitration law, an objective analysis must be taken into consideration. Whether a reasonable person would consider the likelihood of bias in recurring appointments in arbitrations involving the same or similar subjects with a single common party will depend on the specific facts of each case and, in particular, the custom and practice in the relevant field of arbitration. Hence, it was concluded that multiple overlapping appointments in arbitrations wherein the matters are interconnected is rare in nature. Furthermore, taking into consideration professional integrity as well as the experience and reputation of the arbitrator, there is no likelihood of bias. </p> \
             \
             <br> \
             <h7><b>CONCLUSION</b></h7> \
             <br><br> \
             <p>To conclude, the said practise is not only relevant and beneficial in the English Context but also the International Arbitration Practise at large. For instance, most of the parties will appoint an arbitrator who not only is reputable and experienced in nature but also has the relevant specific knowledge governing the said dispute. Herein, there will be a pertinent situation wherein an arbitrator will be reappointed in several cases. For instance, the International Arbitration and Mediation Centre in Hyderabad (IAMC) regularly reappoints the same arbitrator for multiple arbitration matters involving the same party. </p> \
             <p>Herein, a balance Although there is a legal duty on behalf of the arbitrator but an objective analysis with regard to the circumstances surrounding the case to ascertain the likelihood of bias must be taken into consideration. Therefore, there must be a balance between arbitrator’s duty of disclosure and disputing parties’ duty to investigate potential conflicts at the time of appointment of arbitration. </p> \

      <h6><b><u>TOPIC: Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, “International Arbitration and the Rule of Law”</u></b></h6> \
      <br> \
      <p><i>For decades, international arbitration has been favoured with extraordinary support and goodwill from the global community. Amidst the paralysis of decades-long struggles to find cohesive multilateral strategies for issues ranging from global health to climate change and the challenge of poverty, the world has somehow been able to forge a set of common solutions to protect and secure the favoured role of arbitration. That is a real and frankly astonishing triumph of multilateralism and I choose to believe that it reflects a deep and near-universal belief in the cause of sensible dispute resolution for international commerce.</i></p> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Arbitration can be fundamentally enumerated as a method of dispute resolution under the Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism wherein parties mutually agree to refer all or any of the disputes arising out of their contractual relationship to arbitration. Herein, the award which is rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal is binding on the parties. Fundamentally, it is a method for settling disputes that sits outside the court. Martin Domke defines arbitration as voluntarily referring to a dispute to a third party selected by them for decision based on evidence and arguments, presented before the arbitration tribunal and the award of the arbitrator is final and binding.</p> \
      <p>Furthermore, an arbitration agreement can either be in form of an agreement under a main contract or a separate agreement in itself. For instance, in relation to the former, a contract between company A and B involving sale of goods involves a clause for arbitration in case of a dispute. While, on the other hand, in terms of a separate agreement, the parties can directly refer the dispute to arbitration if they have mutually consented to. </p> \
      <br> \
      <h7><b>MAIN BODY</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon has fundamentally emphasised the importance of protecting and securing arbitration as the favoured role of dispute resolution in the modern contemporary scenario. Herein, it can be emphasised that international arbitration plays a prominent role in commercial dispute resolution. The following elaborates the importance of arbitration in the modern commercial scenario, the advantages of arbitration as well as why parties choose arbitration as the favoured method of dispute resolution. </p> \
      <p>Firstly, Party Autonomy can be considered as a cornerstone and core ingredient of an arbitral process which enumerates the right of the parties to determine and decide the rules and regulations governing their disputes. The principle of party autonomy has also been endorsed by the <b>Art. 34(2)(a)(iv) UNCITRAL Model law</b> and forms the base of arbitration. Furthermore, also in accordance to <b>Article V(1)(d)</b>, if the composition of the arbitration tribunal is not in accordance of the procedure decided by the parties or if the arbitrator does not conduct the proceedings in accordance with the procedure decided by the parties, recognition and enforcement of the award can be refused. Hence, the party has the power to decide the procedure governing the arbitration. \
       Secondly, there is impartiality and neutrality in the arbitration process. Herein, the promotion of independence and impartiality holds substantial relevance in the present and future of arbitration, in view of achieving a consensus as well as ensuring effective and efficient dispute resolution by way of arbitration. One of the most essential aspects of any conflict resolution system is the impartiality of the adjudicator, and an individual who has an interest in the effect or conclusion of the dispute should not have any kind of sole authority to designate the individuals as arbitrators. Herein, since the parties jointly appoint the arbitrators which form the arbitration tribunal, there is impartiality and neutrality in the functioning.</p> \
       <p>Thirdly, arbitration can be elaborated as a speedy, effective and less time-consuming form of dispute resolution. Generally, the time period prescribed for completion of an arbitral proceeding is 1 year which can be extended to a further 6 months. Also, taking into consideration the mere fact that arbitration proceedings are not open to the public at large and herein both the tribunal as well as the parties have an obligation to protect and preserve the confidentiality of the hearings, the evidence as well as the awards. </p> \
       <p>Furthermore, taking into consideration the principle of party autonomy and flexibility, the parties have the authority not only to choose their favoured forum of dispute resolution but can also appoint arbitrators who have the required skills and knowledge to effectively resolve the dispute of specialised nature. For instance, a judge in a national court might not have the required extensive knowledge to deal with a dispute of construction arbitration. Herein, the parties can appoint an arbitrator having the specific knowledge. </p> \
       <p>Furthermore, there are a series of laws, rules and regulations emphasising the importance of arbitration. The LCIA Rules are considered exhaustive in nature and are well versed with the current market practises due to which London is one of the most favoured choices of seat of arbitration. For instance, <b>Art. 14</b> of the above-mentioned rules give widest discretion to the tribunal is relation to evidence, technology, submissions etc with the purpose of enhancing productivity. \
       <b>Art 25</b> gives the tribunal the power to grant a series of interim reliefs to the parties. <b>Art. 30</b> emphasises duties of confidentiality on both the tribunal and the party as elaborated above. In terms of the <b>UNICITRAL Model Law, Art 5 </b>states no court shall intervene in the matters. <b>Art. 18</b> emphasises the principle of natural justice and equality and states equal opportunity must be given to parties, whereas <b>Art 19</b> emphasises party autonomy. </p> \
       <p>Despite the series of advantages, there exists a few disadvantages which govern the productivity of arbitration in the modern commercial scenario. Fundamentally, since, an award cannot be reviewed on merits in the court of law, there exists very few and limited grounds wherein an award can be challenged as enumerated in <b>Art V</b> and <b>Section 68</b>. Furthermore, despite arbitration being considered as a cost-effective mode of dispute resolution, there is a substantial rise in fees which are charged by arbitrators as well as arbitral institutions. Also, Arbitration has been evading the promise of speedy resolution owing to the growing complexities of disputes submitted today.</p> \
       <br> \
       <h7><b>CONCLUSION</b></h7> \
      <br><br> \
      <p>Predominantly, in the modern contemporary era, most agreements and contracts have an arbitration clause for resolution of disputes due to the numerous advantages governing arbitration over litigation. Herein, emphasis is laid on the importance of international arbitration is a very important for effective and efficient conduct of trade and commerce. Hence, international arbitration is widely considered as a favoured method of dispute resolution. </p> \
